                of 1 thread doing both physics and rendering, we split it into two threads! 
                Stutter should be almost non-existent as long as your graphics card can 
                handle it! We also have some new blocks and bugfixes!</blockquote>

		<div>
			<blockquote>This build is mainly for stability, but also adds the
				awesome new main menu and markers system! This build should crash
				MUCH less than 0.1.2 but it is not quite crash free yet. Remember
				this is pre-alpha, so play at your own risk! Be sure to run the
				vcredist_x86 that is in the same directory as the game. This will
				install the required microsoft redistributable. Future builds will
				not require you to do this step.</blockquote>

				This build focuses on some multi-threading performance boosts, new
				spawner and sink blocks, new explosives, 3D sound engine, new blocks
				and textures, and various other things! <em>*** Be wary that the new
					multithreading may introduce some bugs when using lots of physics,
					this system is still fresh and needs tuning ***</em>

		<div>
			<blockquote>This is the first public pre-alpha build for the game
				Seed Of Andromeda. This build is more of a physics playground than
				anything. Feel free to fly around and build, or find bugs. Keep in
				mind that there are many known bugs that still need to be fixed in
				this version! This build seems to be quite buggy for windows 8, so I
				will be prioritizing fixing that. Mac support is planned in the
				future but this build will not run on macs. The world editor will be
				ready soon, and then you will all be able to create your very own
				trees, biomes, blocks, and worlds! Have fun!</blockquote>
