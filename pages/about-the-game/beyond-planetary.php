                Want more than just one measly moon? Launch into the heavens and fly off to explore other mind-blowing worlds; discover yet more 
                life forms, ecosystems, and even primitive civilisations! The spaceflight system in Seed of Andromeda offers the ability to fly 
                your own custom-designed spacecraft anywhere you desire, with the ability to utilise computer systems that you have developed or 
                have bought off other characters.

                or civilisation’s, insatiable appetite? Mine the heavens to match your needs, build orbital refineries, automated mining systems and 
                move on to build structures on grander scales than ever imagined before!

                Happened by a new world you have come to love? Why not build a colony ship and bring a whole load of MPCs to the new world, and 
                colonise it!? Become the founder of yet another home in the stars for humanity! Over time, these colonies will spread around the 
                planet and yet more cities will be founded for you to trade with, explore and find work in.

                As you develop and expand the technologies available to you, build a starship and head out of the Trinity system and explore other stars! 
                Maybe you will discover other intelligent life to trade with, work for, fight against or do any other thing you can dream of. If you’re 
                feeling ambitious, you could even expand that colonisation project to entirely new star systems!
