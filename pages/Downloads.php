                This build introduces a huge performance boost! Instead 
                of 1 thread doing both physics and rendering, we split it into two threads!
                Stutter should be almost non-existent as long as your graphics card can 
                handle it! We also have some new blocks and bugfixes!

            <h4 class="version">V0.1.5</h4>&nbsp;- This build fixes a ton of crash bugs, improves particle
            performance, adds animated explosions, adds a new texture pack
            system, and adds some new blocks! Please report any bugs to the
            forums.

            <h4 class="version">V0.1.4</h4>&nbsp;- This build brings a huge pile of needed bug fixes and
            crash fixes! Not all bugs have been fixed, but it is getting ever
            more stable! This build also introduces some new textures thanks to
            _zombiehunter and some new planets thanks to sir_moodz. Have fun!

            <h4 class="version">V0.1.3</h4>&nbsp;- This build is mainly for stability, but also adds the
            awesome new main menu and markers system! This build should crash
            MUCH less than 0.1.2 but it is not quite crash free yet. Remember
            this is pre-alpha, so play at your own risk! Be sure to run the
            vcredist_x86 that is in the same directory as the game. This will
            install the required microsoft redistributable. Future builds will
            not require you to do this step.

            <h4 class="version">V0.1.2.1</h4>&nbsp;- This build focuses on some multi-threading performance boosts, new
            spawner and sink blocks, new explosives, 3D sound engine, new blocks
            and textures, and various other things! <em>*** Be wary that the new
            multithreading may introduce some bugs when using lots of physics,
            this system is still fresh and needs tuning ***</em>

            <h4 class="version">V0.1.1</h4>&nbsp;- This is the first public pre-alpha build for the game
            Seed Of Andromeda. This build is more of a physics playground than
            anything. Feel free to fly around and build, or find bugs. Keep in
            mind that there are many known bugs that still need to be fixed in
            this version! This build seems to be quite buggy for windows 8, so I
            will be prioritizing fixing that. Mac support is planned in the
            future but this build will not run on macs. The world editor will be
            ready soon, and then you will all be able to create your very own
            trees, biomes, blocks, and worlds! Have fun!
