                The Earth is no longer sufficient for humanity, which has looked to the stars for new homes to expand to. You are amongst the 
                first wave of colonists to leave Earth for the stars, your destination: the Trinity star system. On your arrival, you are greeted 
                by a none too friendly, advanced race, who launch a viscous attack on your colonial fleet. In the carnage, you descend in an escape 
                capsule to the surface of Aldrin, a moon of Hyperion, a gas giant in the Trinity star system. You must make what you can of this new 
                world, with your limited supplies, what you do is your choice... it is your story that is to unfold.
                <br/><br/>Seed of Andromeda is your game, you play it, you make your own decisions, and you are the driver of your story. When you play Seed of 
                Andromeda, you will always create your own story, and every time you play again, you will have an entirely new and unique story to tell! 
                Seed of Andromeda is a decision-driven game. We want Seed of Andromeda to be about you, the player, not about a pre-written story that 
                your actions are dictated by.

                Now Earth's story is over, and yours is beginning... will you join forces with other survivors and try to create a utopian world? A 
                dictatorial empire? Maybe go the lone wolf and explore the vast landscapes of the world you have crashed down on? The choices are as 
                endless as your imagination! The choices you make however, have a great impact on how the world you inhabit evolves; the local tribes 
                may react badly to your presence on their lands, an advanced race may appreciate your trade with them, all these relationship changes 
                will affect your further interactions with those groups, so if you want a prosperous relationship, play nice!

                While we stand by the idea of not forcing a story on you, we don't want to leave you with nothing! Seed of Andromeda has a fully-realised 
                technology tree for you, and other inhabitants of the game's worlds, to progress along. Always wanted that ray gun your mum promised for 
                your 18th? Well get researching and engineering wondrous technologies! Don't want to while away in a lab? Then get out and explore, find 
                alien crash sites and learn from the past! Don't much like the idea of trekking through the wilderness? Butter up some NPCs with flattery 
                and sweet talk and they might divulge some of their hard earned technologies! Or just blow them up and steal it... it's all up to you!
