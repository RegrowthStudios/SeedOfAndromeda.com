    	<h2>Series Preface</h2>
    	<p>
    		Before starting out my updated series on design musing, I thought I would open with a quick disclaimer as well as where you may discuss the ideas 
    		suggested in these musings and your own ideas in relation to them.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		So, first with the disclaimer: my musings in this series are by no means confirmation or denial of any specific game mechanics in Seed of Andromeda, 
    		they are just as the title would suggest, design musings of my own. I post them for their popularity, to test the water - as it were - for certain 
    		design concepts and also to provoke discussion on the forums
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Phew, with that necessary disclaimer out of the way, where may you discuss the ideas described in this series? Why the Seed of Androemda forums of 
    		course! At the end of each post, I will link it to a sticky post on the forums where people can discuss the ideas and propose their own alternatives 
    		(though, if they are quite major alternatives, I would highly encourage you to make your own thread on the forums for greater visibility!).

	    <h2>Crafting, Research and Intergroup Cooperation - Volume I.I</h2>
	    <h3>Preface</h3>
	    <p>
	    	To start this volume off, I would like to open up with a comment on what I consider to be good practice in creating an immersive experience for the 
	    	player.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Firstly, I do not believe in the use of GUIs where there is no reason or explanation for the use of them: they simply work to slow down the flow 
	    	of the game, and they do not reflect real-life processes (if they are without explanation). The latter point is of great concern when the 
	    	crafting process has to incorporate things as advanced as the technologies that will be attainable and creatable in SoA.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Take the example of Minecraft, its crafting system is unintuitive, lacks any form of scalability and so for that reason, almost every mod either has 
	    	to introduce a whole new crafting system for its own items, or it has to have an expansive wiki that players refer to for every creation. This 
	    	issue runs nicely into the second good practice I believe in: keeping the player in-game and enthused to do so at all times. This means, rather 
	    	than just not allowing wikis to be created, or making alt+tab kill the game to discourage the use of wikis, instead, make sure your system is so 
	    	engaging - and so rewarding - that the player finds themselves wanting to beat the system rather than let others beat it for them. This won't stop 
	    	all players, but it will do what you should only ever aspire to do as a developer of a sandbox game: encourage a play-style rather than force it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Thirdly, the process should be challenging for the player - not the character - doing so will drag the player into the game via the character, make 
	    	them try to determine techniques to complete tasks that benefit them. Such challenge shouldn't be unsurpassable, it doesn't even have to be significant 
	    	in all cases, but it must be there. Dark Souls has its insanely complicated combat, Skyrim (at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to combat in 
	    	RPGs) has a much easier combat system, but it still requires some player skill - contributing to placing the player inside the character 
	    	(Skyrim utilises other systems to enhance this player-character melding). Now, consider these games, and then consider a game such as Runescape, when 
	    	in combat in Runescape, the extent of the player's contribution to combat is largely clicking the target once and then watching. The introduction 
	    	of even a little challenge to the player, in the case of Skyrim (even in third person camera mode), still bonds the player to the character in a 
	    	significantly stronger manner than Runescape or any other games of that kind - this in turn provides an immersive-ness that will make the experience 
	    	all the better for the player.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Finally, in crafting there should always be a hard-limit of seven stages to crafting - this is to make a crafting process not overwhelm the puny ability 
	    	of the human brain to remember things. I would like to take this number, and suggest how to apply it to the crafting system I am going to suggest - 
	    	but that must come later, for now, however, I would just like to say that this system is one that seems to be valid from all my personal experiences 
	    	with Minecraft mods, and similar crafting processes in other games.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	A further practice that I would recommend as a good one, but as a general rule of thumb more than focussed on one particular area is to keep to a quote 
	    	that is largely aimed at theories of the physical universe, but applies equally in this case also: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, 
	    	but no simpler.". What this means is that a game's mechanics should be as easy and understandable as possible for the player, without becoming so simple 
	    	that the feel and function of the game mechanics simply become monotonous and non-engaging to the player.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Crucial Point</h3>
	    <p>
	    	<em>
	    		I do not use player and character interchangeably in this post series at any point. So if I say the player, I mean the player, and vice versa.
	    	</em>
	    </p>
	    <h3>Part I - Crafting</h3>
	    <p>
	    	The crafting process should avoid any grid methods, such as the one employed in Minecraft - they are simply too unintuitive for any sane person to 
	    	want to use them for anything beyond the complexity of items in a game such as Minecraft. As such, several other methods can be utilised in 
	    	conjunction, in order to replace the grid.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Firstly, another example:
	    </p>
	    <blockquote>
		    <p>
		    	A workbench, when placed, would cover say 2x2x2 or 4x2x2 blocks and a player would be able to interact with it while holding objects to place 
		    	them on it, or an empty hand to remove objects, then they would be able to use tools on the placed units to do certain tasks. For example, 
		    	a player wishes to create a dagger, they would have to chop down a tree, get hold of some of its wood and then cut down a block of that wood 
		    	to get a smaller piece of wood. Taking that piece of wood to the workbench, the player would place it on the workbench and then use a knife on 
		    	it to carve it into a handle. The player would then go out and hunt down an animal such as a wolf or a deer, skin the animal and then, having 
		    	placed a tanning rack - again of multi-block proportions - put the skin on the rack to be left to tan. The player would then cut the leather down 
		    	on the workbench. The player would then be able to use the leather on the handle in order to provide a grip for the to-be-made dagger. The player 
		    	must now find a vein of iron from which to obtain iron ore to smelt, taking this iron ore to a furnace, the player would then be able to heat up 
		    	the furnace (with the help of their PDA to attain the desired temperature). After smelting the ore into its molten form, the player would be able 
		    	to siphon off some of the iron into a mould via a chute, which would allow a blade shape to be formed. Taking this with some tongs to a forge, the 
		    	player would then hammer out the blade and then temper it in a bucket/trough of cold water before attaching it to the handle and grip.
		    </p>
	    <blockquote>
	    <p>
	    	This example follows all of the key good practises I identified earlier: GUIs are avoided where unnecessary - and in all cases where they are used, 
	    	they have an explanation in the form of interacting with an electronic device known as a PDA. Secondly, the process is intuitive and requires little 
	    	thought on the player's part to achieve (unlike other systems, such as Minecraft's, in which the same creation process would all take place utilising 
	    	a pattern system that doesn't lend itself to what we learn from reality). Thirdly, it offers a challenge to the player themselves, one which can be 
	    	highly customised to offer a suitable difficulty at that, in which the player can have to contend with such things as siphoning off the right amount 
	    	of iron else wasting resources or reducing effectiveness of the object created. Other such challenges could exist for maintaining temperature of the 
	    	furnace through cues provided by the PDA or from carving the object reasonably to not weaken the object while also avoiding making it too chunky and 
	    	so more weighty. Finally, there are only a few stages to this, while you can break down actions much further, all the player need remember is "daggers 
	    	require a handle, grip and blade, a blade requires iron, a grip requires leather and a handle requires wood" and then "to make a blade I need to heat 
	    	and then hammer out/cool the iron, to make a grip I need to cut the leather and to make a handle I need to carve the wood". These memorisations are 
	    	natural to humans and highly achievable with utter simplicity - and best of all, there will be ways (as I shall describe in future volumes) of how to 
	    	get hold of such methods without the player having to discover them themselves.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
	    <p>
	    	This is all for this blog post, but I will follow up with two more for Volume I, before moving on to Volume II where I will tackled research and how 
	    	to may be done to engage the user is many aspects of the game and make that experience enjoyable.
