                The Earth is no longer sufficient for humanity, which has looked to the stars for new homes to expand to. You are amongst the first wave of colonists to leave Earth, your destination: 
                the Trinity star system. On your arrival, you are greeted by a none too friendly, advanced race, who launch a vicious attack on your colonial fleet. In the carnage, you descend in an 
                escape capsule to the surface of Aldrin, a moon of the gas giant Hyperion. With your limited supplies, you must make what you can of this new world. What you do is your choice… it is 
                your story that is to unfold.
                <br/><br/>
                Earth's story is over, and yours is beginning... will you join forces with other survivors and try to create a utopian world? A dictatorial empire? Maybe go the lone wolf and explore 
                the vast landscapes of the world you have crashed down on? The choices are as endless as your imagination!
