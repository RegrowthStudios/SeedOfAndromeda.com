                The Earth is no longer sufficient for humanity, which has looked to the stars for new homes to expand to. You are amongst the first wave 
                of colonists to leave Earth for the stars, your destination: the Trinity star system. On your arrival, you are greeted by a none too friendly, 
                advanced race, who launch a vicious attack on your colonial fleet. In the carnage, you descend in an escape capsule to the surface of Aldrin - 
                your destination - a moon of Hyperion, a gas giant in the Trinity star system. You must make what you can of this new world, with your limited 
                supplies, what you do is your choice... it is your story that is to unfold.
                <br/><br/>Earth's story is over, and yours is beginning... will you join forces with other survivors and try to create a utopian world? A dictatorial 
                empire? Maybe go the lone wolf and explore the vast landscapes of the world you have crashed down on? The choices are as endless as your imagination!

                Crash landing on Aldrin leaves you in a precarious situation; how will you fare during your first few nights, weeks? Beware prowling packs of ravenous animals, 
                starving or dehydrating, even As you get a foothold on this new world, however, perhaps with the assistance of fellow colonists, you will find that the world 
                you have landed on is not just a place to fear, but a place to treasure. As you progress, no longer will the environments you inhabit be places to survive in, 
                but places to thrive in! Don’t worry though, there will always be new places, with new challenges and treasures, to explore!

                Seed of Andromeda features a rich main story to play through in the story-mode of the game, offering an expansive set of sub-story arcs each with multiple possible 
                outcomes, all affecting how the end game will play out. Your decisions define how the story progresses, and the conclusion of the main story arc has more possible 
                outcomes than you can shake a space flotilla at! We’d love to tell you more, but we couldn’t bear to spoil such an awesome story for you.

                Seed of Andromeda utilises a ground-breaking spherical world system unique to the game, which allows you to generate your own full scale procedural voxel planets to explore, 
                which not only sounds cool, but is cool! Exploring a world with real horizons, and orbiting from space has never been more epic. Beyond that, the game has unparalleled physics 
                simulation, offering power over your environment (and it power over you!) that cannot be experienced in any other game!
