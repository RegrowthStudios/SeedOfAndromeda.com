                Seed of Andromeda has a few core focuses, exploration being one of the most critical of those. Explore incredible vistas, watch 
                the sun dance on the surface of a lake, delve into the depths of complex and varied cave systems, discover ancient ruins worlds 
                over and meet many different races and animals! Always be aware of possible new discoveries waiting around every corner, but also 
                beware the perils that could lie in wait around those corners too!

                Colonists that survive the crash landing to Aldrin won't sit idle while you make your way about the moon; they'll work together to 
                do their job: colonise Aldrin. You will encounter colonies small and large throughout your explorations of Aldrin and, as they develop, 
                towns, cities and eventually megatropolises will be founded. You don't have to passively watch this take place, either; you can have a 
                direct hand in the formation of any of these cities if you so desire, and even come to lead the people of these places!

                Colonies of all shapes and sizes will trade with one another, based on the supplies and demands each colony has. You can have a direct 
                influence by trading between colonies yourself, or causing the supply of one place or another to change (did anyone say farm burning? 
                We didn't!). Taking advantage of these trading opportunities can quickly earn you a whole bunch of money, as well as earning you a 
                reputation as a Master Trader!

                Seed of Andromeda wouldn't be whole without featuring living, breathing worlds. Critical to this are the dynamic ecosystems the game 
                simulates - predators and prey chasing each other, animals moving around the world to search for new food and water, diseases 
                spreading through the population of animals, and a hell of a lot more! You may shape the world, but it doesn't sit by when you 
                are busy with other epic quests.
